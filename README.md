# propublica-data
A python script that uses the Propublica API to retrieve data (in csv format) on any list of non-profit US organizations. To run, simply type "python propublica.py" in your terminal. The data will be outputted as "data.csv".

Currently the script is extracting data on final clubs and other student organizations at Harvard. To look up data on other organizations, simply look for their propublica numbers and replace the Harvard numbers with them in the script.

The script may take around a minute or so to run.
